    <p>Can you think of anything else that can trigger memories and emotions with simple sound and harmonies. For me
        personally there are very few things.Some people go to church, I turn up the radio</p>
    <p>I believe we are energy, not our bodies. Energy can't be created nor destroyed. And what is music? It's sound
        waves and ENERGY that I believe I will become part of when my rental car I call a body has run it's last mile
        here on earth</p>
